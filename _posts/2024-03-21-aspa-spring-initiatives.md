The ASPAICT welcomes you!

If you're an ASPA member (all BPA students are), you are welcome to join in this journey of building a more connected and informed community. To make our digital presence as dynamic as our organization, we are putting together a dedicated web and content team.

We are specifically looking for members with skills in:

*   **Web Development:** HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and experience with frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
*   **Content Creation:** News writers and sports writers to craft compelling stories and reports.
*   **Visual Design:** Layout artists and photographers to shape our visual identity and document our events.

This is your platform to build, create, and leave your mark. Your work will be the public face of ASPA.
